"""Refresh the application marks in ui/ui-icons.svg from Simple Icons.

Run by hand, like vendor-icons.py, and the result is committed -- neither a
build nor an install ever fetches anything.

    scripts/brand-icons.py --check    # fail if the committed sprite is stale

Simple Icons ships one solid path per brand on a 24x24 grid with no fill
attribute. WebDesk's own icons are hairline strokes in currentColor, and a
brand mark is never going to be that drawing. What it can do is share the
grid, take its colour from currentColor like everything else, and be scaled a
little under full size so a solid glyph does not outweigh a stroked one beside
it in the dock. Brand colours are deliberately dropped: an icon takes the
colour of the control it sits in, which is the whole point of currentColor.

The icons are CC0 1.0. The marks themselves remain the trademarks of their
owners; this uses them to label the application they belong to and nothing
else.
