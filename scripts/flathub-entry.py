"""Write a `flathub!` catalog entry from a Flathub application id.

    scripts/flathub-entry.py org.gimp.GIMP org.kde.krita
    scripts/flathub-entry.py --search "photo editor"

An entry is short enough that typing one is not the hard part. The container
entries this catalog used to carry had to answer for a published port, a state
directory, `PUID`/`PGID`, a shared memory size, a clock, a render node and
whether the application survived a path prefix -- seven questions with
lookup-able answers, and the reason those entries are gone. An entry here
answers none of them, because the application is already running as the right
user on the right machine. What is left is a judgement call, so this prints what
the judgement needs and then the entry.

**Size is the part that has already decided a catalog question once.**
`intellij-idea` was dropped on size alone: nothing about it was broken, it
simply unpacks to roughly 9 GB, which was more than the free space on the
filesystem images were stored on -- so the entry most likely to fail its
own install was also the one whose failure would take the rest of the machine
down with it. Flatpaks are smaller than desktop images, and a runtime is shared
by every application built on it, so the second GNOME app on a host costs its
own size and nothing more. Those are two different kinds of cost, so this prints
them as two numbers rather than one.

**What it cannot answer, and says so every time.** Whether the application is
usable over RFB at a fixed initial resolution, whether it opens dialogs a kiosk
compositor holding one surface handles badly, and whether the session bus names
it asks to talk to matter when it does not get them. Those are answered by
running it. What comes out of here is a draft entry, not a finished one.

**It refuses rather than guessing.** An id Flathub does not have, an id that is
not a desktop application, and an application marked end-of-life all stop here
with a reason.

The icon is always `a-box`, because a brand mark is a separate step: add the
Simple Icons slug to `scripts/brand-icons.py`, re-run it, and change the one
line.

Standard library only, and it reads Flathub over the network every time -- there
is nothing to vendor, because the answer changes when the app is rebuilt.
Nothing here writes a file. The output is meant to be read and then pasted into
`src/catalog.rs` by hand, since a script that edited the catalog would be a
script that could add an entry nobody read.
