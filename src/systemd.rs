//! The signed-in user's service manager, for the applications drawn on this host.
//!
//! One manager, and it is deliberately not the machine's. A streamed
//! application's subject is your home directory, so a single host-wide instance
//! shared by everyone would be pointed at the wrong person's files. Each of
//! these runs in the systemd *user* manager of whoever opened it.
//!
//! This file used to have two halves. The other one drove `/etc/systemd/system`
//! on behalf of the adopted host services, and it went when they did -- along
//! with `write_unit`, which was the only place WebDesk ever wrote a unit into
//! `/etc` as root. What is left never leaves a user's own manager, which makes the
//! security argument shorter than it was rather than merely different: the most
//! a request can now cause is a process in the requester's own session.
//!
//! **The rule that survives is the one that was doing the work: the template is
//! a constant.** `APP_UNIT` is a `&'static str` below, so the set of units that
//! can exist is a property of the build. A request contributes one thing, a
//! slug, and it becomes an instance name -- `webdesk-app@<slug>.service` -- that
//! `webdesk app-session` resolves against the catalog compiled into the binary
//! and refuses if it is not there. A unit whose `ExecStart` interpolated a
//! Flatpak id would be a way to run any Flatpak on this host; `%i` is not.
//!
//! Everything here degrades to a report rather than an error. A host without
//! systemd at all is a host where these entries simply cannot run, and saying so
//! is more use than a failure that reads like a bug.

Type=simple

# No User=, and that absence is the entry rather than an omission. A system unit
# would have to name one person, and this is an application whose subject is
# whoever opened it. Started in your own manager it is your files it opens,
# which is the only version of it worth having.
#
# The argument is a slug and never an application id -- see the doc comment.
ExecStart={exe} app-session %i

# systemd cannot reach the application on its own. `flatpak run` hands it to the
# session helper, which puts it in a systemd *scope* of its own outside this
# service's cgroup, so stopping the service kills the compositor and the
# launcher and leaves the application running -- holding this user's files, with
# nothing left anywhere to draw it. `flatpak kill` by id is the one handle that
# reaches into that scope.
#
# The id may not appear here, so the kill is spelled the only way this unit is
# allowed to spell anything: the same binary, the same slug, and the id looked
# up in the catalog it was built with. The leading `-` because nothing to kill
# is the ordinary case and is not a failed stop. There is no matching
# ExecStartPre because ExecStart is ours and clears the ground itself.
ExecStop=-{exe} app-session %i --kill

# Said out loud because a service unit that omits it reads as an oversight.
# Quitting the application is how you close it. `on-failure` would not fire on that, but an application that dies on
# startup would loop for as long as the window is open, and the dock would paint
# `restarting` forever instead of `failed` once -- and only one of those is a
# fact somebody can act on.
Restart=no

# The stop above is one `flatpak kill` and a socket to unlink. If that has not
# finished in fifteen seconds it is wedged, and the default ninety would leave
# the dock showing an app that is closing for a minute and a half.

# No [Install] section, deliberately. This is started when somebody opens the
