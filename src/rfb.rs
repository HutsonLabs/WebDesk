//! The pixels of a streamed app, carried to the browser.
//!
//! A streamed entry (`catalog::Streamed`) runs under `cage` with `wayvnc`
//! serving RFB on a unix socket. This module is the one hop between that socket
//! and a WebSocket the browser's noVNC client speaks: it checks the session,
//! works out which socket the person asking is entitled to, opens it, and then
//! copies bytes until one of the two ends stops.
//!
//! **It was deliberately not the reverse proxy, and it outlived it.** WebDesk
//! used to carry a `proxy.rs` that put an HTTP app on this origin under
//! `/app/<slug>/`, and nearly everything that file did was about HTTP -- a
//! request line to rewrite into origin form, a prefix to announce, hop-by-hop
//! headers to drop, `Set-Cookie` pinned to a path so one app could not read
//! another's, `X-Frame-Options` taken away so the frame rendered at all. None of
//! it applied here. There is no request to forward, because RFB is not
//! request/response and the server speaks first; no header to rewrite, because
//! the far end has never heard of HTTP; and no cookie to pin, because nothing
//! behind this socket knows a browser is involved. Take all of that away and
//! what is left is a byte pump.
//!
//! Routing this through the proxy would have meant carrying the whole of that
//! machinery to reach the one call that opens a socket. Keeping them apart is
//! why the proxy could be deleted without touching this file.
//!
//! The rule that is this file's own is in `ws_rfb`: the uid is taken from the
//! session and never from the request.
