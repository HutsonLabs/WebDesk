//! Running one streamed application, in the session of the person who opened it.
//!
//! This is what `webdesk-app@<slug>.service` starts, and it runs as an ordinary
//! user with no privilege at all: a systemd *user* unit in their own manager,
//! reached the way `systemd::user_act` describes.
//!
//! **Why the binary and not a script.** The unit is one template for every
//! streamed app, and its `ExecStart` is handed `%i` -- a slug. A slug has to
//! become a Flatpak application id somewhere, and the only place that may happen
//! is inside a program that carries the catalog, because the whole rule this
//! project is built on is that the set of things which may be run is a property
//! of the build. A shell script taking an id from an argument would be exactly
//! the hole `catalog.rs` and `systemd.rs` are written to avoid, wearing a
//! systemd unit as a hat. So the unit runs `webdesk app-session <slug>`, this
//! resolves it against `CATALOG`, and anything not in there is refused before a
//! process is spawned.
//!
//! What it then does is start a headless `cage` holding exactly one application
//! and a `wayvnc` serving it on a socket only this user can open. Nothing here
//! listens on the network.
//!
//! **Three roles, one argv.** `webdesk app-session <slug>` is the unit's
//! `ExecStart`; `--kill` is its `ExecStop`; `--inside-cage` is what `cage`
//! itself is given to run, and is never typed by anybody. They are one file and
//! one catalog lookup because they have to agree about what a slug means, and
//! the cheapest way for two programs to agree is to be the same program -- the
//! argument `helper.rs` already makes for `--helper`.
