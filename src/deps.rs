//! What the host needs before an app will open, and installing it on one press.
//!
//! Two things need something on the host that WebDesk itself does not: an app
//! in the catalog needs `flatpak`, a compositor and an RFB server, and the host
//! panels need `cockpit-bridge`. None of them is a build dependency, so
//! `install.sh` cannot simply require them -- a host that will only ever run the
//! file manager and the terminal should not be made to carry a compositor.
//!
//! So they are *probed* and *offered*. `report` says what is missing and what it
//! would cost to fix; `install` fixes it, streaming the package manager's output
//! into the same log the Apps window is already watching. That is the whole
//! "single click" -- the same "offered, not installed" shape `flatpak.rs`
//! already uses for a prerequisite, moved in front of the install rather than
//! inside it.
//!
//! **A package name is not always a fact about a manager.** `catalog::Prereq`
//! has one field per manager and says `None` where nobody has checked. That
//! covers most of what is below, and two rows need more than it can express:
//!
//! - **`dnf` is three package universes, not one.** Fedora has `cage` and
//!   `wayvnc` in its base repositories. Enterprise Linux has neither: they are in
//!   EPEL, `wayvnc` from EPEL 9 and `cage` only from EPEL 10 -- there is no EPEL
//!   9 build of `cage` at any version, so the streamed half of the catalog is
//!   simply unavailable on that generation. One `dnf` field cannot say "yes,
//!   after you enable EPEL, and not at all before EL10", so `ElFacts` says it
//!   instead, and `Dep::provides_here` reads the host rather than guessing.
//!   Enabling EPEL adds a third-party repository to somebody's host, which is
//!   not a thing an installer does on their behalf: WebDesk reports that EPEL is
//!   what is missing and leaves the decision where it belongs.
//! - **On Arch, the bridge cannot be had without the console.** There is no
//!   split package: `cockpit` is all of Cockpit, web server included. The name is
//!   given rather than withheld -- it is true, and an operator can weigh it --
//!   but the `why` says out loud what comes with it, because "only the bridge,
//!   never `cockpit-ws`" is the premise of `cockpit.rs` and on that one
//!   distribution package selection cannot keep the promise.
//!
//! **One fact, one home.** The bridge's package names live in
//! `cockpit::BRIDGE_PREREQ` and this table points at them, so the row here and
//! the `503 not-installed` refusal the host panels return cannot disagree about
//! what would fix the host. That refusal's `missing.bin` is this row's `key`, on
//! purpose: the window that receives it can turn it into an install without a
//! third table in between.
//!
//! **Nothing here takes a package name from a request.** `install` matches keys
//! against `RUNTIME` and drops everything else, so the widest thing a browser
//! can ask for is one of the rows below. That is the same rule the catalog
//! is built on: a request may choose *which* of the operations the build
//! contains runs, never *what* the operation is.
