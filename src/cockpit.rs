//! `cockpit-bridge`, used as a library rather than as a web console.
//!
//! **Only the bridge, never `cockpit-ws`.** `cockpit-bridge` is a separate
//! package from Cockpit's web server and its pages: one binary that speaks a
//! newline-framed JSON channel protocol over stdio, with no port, no HTTP, no
//! login page and no UI. Installing it surfaces none of Cockpit, which is why
//! this is the shape chosen rather than an iframe with a second sign-in behind
//! it.
//!
//! **It runs as the signed-in user.** Spawned the way `pty.rs` spawns a shell,
//! so the kernel enforces what this session may read and write -- the same
//! property that makes Cockpit's own bridge safe, and the reason none of this
//! needs a privileged daemon of its own.
//!
//! **The protocol is terminated here and never tunnelled to the browser.**
//! Cockpit's own client opens channels from JavaScript because Cockpit's UI
//! *is* JavaScript. Handing that to a browser would hand it a `stream` channel,
//! which is a shell by another name, and it would break the rule the rest of
//! this program is built on: a request may choose *which* of the operations the
//! build contains runs, never *what* the operation is. So every endpoint here is
//! a named, fixed channel with a validated parameter, and the bridge stays an
//! implementation detail.
//!
//! **Not having the bridge is an answer, not a failure.** `cockpit-bridge` is
//! no dependency of WebDesk and most hosts will not have it, so its absence is
//! an ordinary state of the machine -- the same argument `systemd::state` makes
//! for `absent`. Every handler below refuses an absent bridge with `503` and
//! `"reason": "not-installed"`, naming the package that would fix it, and keeps
//! `502` and `"reason": "bridge-failed"` for a bridge that is installed and did
//! not work. Those two must never be confused: they are what the dependency
//! installer reads to decide whether to offer the install, and offering to
//! install a package that is already there is how a button becomes a loop.
