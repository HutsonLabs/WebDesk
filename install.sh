# engine, then a compositor and an RFB server, then a Cockpit bridge -- because
# WebDesk used to run applications itself, and each way of doing that needed
# software on the host that WebDesk is not. It does not run applications any
# more. An app on this desk is either built in -- Files, Terminal -- or it is a
# URL somebody typed, and a URL needs nothing installed anywhere.
#
# So this installer installs WebDesk and stops: a binary, a unit, a PAM file and
# a conf. That was always the default; there is now no other option to offer,
# and no closing summary of what the host is still missing, because it is not
# missing anything. A WD_APPS left in an older install.conf is read and ignored.
